    <h2>What is React?</h2>
    <p>
      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) on the
      web. React is a declarative, component based library that allows
      developers to build reusable UI components and It follows the Virtual DOM
      (Document Object Model) approach, which optimizes rendering performance by
      minimizing DOM updates. React is fast and works well with other tools and
      libraries. It allows you to create complex user interfaces using
      “components,” or small, self-contained pieces of code. It controls the
      view layer in web applications. Despite the fact that React is more of a
      library than a language, it is frequently used in web development.
